# Discord Bot
Simple hello world discord bot created using golang and [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)

Made with guidance from Sandeep Kamath's [article](https://medium.com/@mssandeepkamath/building-a-simple-discord-bot-using-go-12bfca31ad5d) *Building a Simple Discord Bot Using Go*.

## Running
Navigate to file structure in Command Prompt or Terminal and execute the following command:
```
go run main.go
```

This will activate the bot in the Discord channel until the command shell is cancelled (e.g. ctrl + C)
